(sqlalchemy-challenge)
Work for SQLAlchemy Homework for UoA Data Visualization Bootcamp

## Climate Jupyter Notebook

#### The work for the climate portion was completed. Creating dataframes from the queries makes data wrangling much more manageable. I am somewhat doubtful about the shape of the histograms and the binning. I would need to look at the data in the dataframe to see if something is amiss. Did both pandas histograms as well as matplotlib ones and they had originally given me different shapes although the binning was the same but when re-run the shape change to the final one in this repository. Due to time constrains, I moved to the next portion of the assignment.

## App Python File

#### The API initiated and the different routes show the necessary information. Ran into some difficulty formatting the last route so it would reflect correctly when jsonify is run. Some playing around with the list and dictionaries help improved the json printout when the route was run.

## Temp Analysis Bonus 1

#### Attempted the bonus and was able to run the statistical analysis. I would need to brush up on my stats knowledge, as I am unsure the test was run correctly in terms of equal or unequal variance.
